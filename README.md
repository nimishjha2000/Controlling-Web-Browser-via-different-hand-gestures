# Hand-web Browser â€“ Controlling Web Browser via different hand gestures

The Objective of my hack is to design a robust and efficient system which will be able to control the browser via hand gestures i.e. different hand gestures will be assigned to different sites. So, if we show a particular hand gesture, a particular site will open up in a new tab.

Everyone has some sites which are used very frequently. For example:- If someone is fond of social media, he/she can assign different hand gestures for sites such as Facebook, Instagram, and youtube. So, instead of typing the whole site name, you would be able to open the site in a new tab with just a hand gesture.
 

Open and run main.py
Enter the sites name for different gestures as asked
Now use the hand gestures to control your web browser
